# Sketch Tree

Sketch Tree is a workflow that utilizes Sketchlib to estimate the core genome and generate a RapidNJ tree. It is designed to process input from assemblies and produce plots

A common workflow model would be
```
input_fastqs
| ASSEMBLER
| groupTuple
| SKETCHLIB_TREE
```
SKETCHLIB_TREE expects inputs as 

[[ID: name of tree], [assembly1, assembly2, assembly3, ....]]

## Key Features
- Automatically estimates the core genome from input assemblies.
- Computes an ANI matrix using Sketchlib.
- Generates and visualizes a RapidNJ tree from the matrix.
## Requirements
This workflow does not require any specific parameters to run.
