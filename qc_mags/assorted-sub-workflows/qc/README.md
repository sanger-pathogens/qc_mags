# QC workflow

This workflow takes a pair of FASTQs and runs processes to determine the quality of a sample, outputting a `'pass'` or `'fail'` for each process.

### FastQC
If either of the FASTQs do not meet the required standard for the specified criteria in the FASTQC summary.txt file (based on the files provided to `--fastqc_pass_criteria` and `--fastqc_no_fail_criteria`), the sample is considered poor quality and a `'fail'` will be output. Otherwise, a `'pass'` will be output.

Example FastQC summary.txt:
```
PASS    Basic Statistics    SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
PASS    Per base sequence quality   SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
PASS    Per sequence quality scores SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
WARN    Per base sequence content   SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
WARN    Per sequence GC content SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
PASS    Per base N content  SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
PASS    Sequence Length Distribution    SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
PASS    Sequence Duplication Levels SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
PASS    Overrepresented sequences   SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
FAIL    Adapter Content SAMN11586388_1.fastq.gz
```

Example criteria file:
```
["Per base sequence quality", "Per sequence quality scores", "Per base N content"]
```

If provided to `--fastqc_pass_criteria`, these criteria would need a `'PASS'` for the sample to pass. If provided to `--fastqc_no_fail_criteria`, the criteria would need a `'PASS'` or a `'WARN'` for the sample to pass. Other criteria would be allowed to have a `'FAIL'` (or `'WARN'`).

### Taxonomy Profiling

If the most abundant genus or species in the Kraken or Sylph report is below a set threshold, the sample is marked as ‘fail’, meaning it may be contaminated or low quality. If the abundance meets or exceeds the threshold, the sample is marked as ‘pass’. You can adjust these thresholds using the `genus_abundance_threshold` and `species_abundance_threshold` parameters.

### Parameters
```
 FastQC
      --save_fastqc
            default: false
            Flag to publish FastQC output
      --fastqc_pass_criteria
            default: assorted-sub-workflows/qc/assets/fastqc_pass_criteria.json
            JSON file containing definition of an array specifying which items in the FastQC summary.txt are required to have the value PASS for the sample to be considered a pass
      --fastqc_no_fail_criteria
            default: assorted-sub-workflows/qc/assets/fastqc_no_fail_criteria.json
            JSON file containing definition of an array specifying which items in the FastQC summary.txt are required to NOT have the value FAIL for the sample to be considered a pass (i.e. they could have WARN)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Taxonomy Profiling QC
      --genus_abundance_threshold
            default: 90
            Fail the sample if the top genus abundance is lower than this
      --species_abundance_threshold
            default: 85
            Fail the sample if the top species abundance is lower than this
```

NB: this subworkflow is designed to be used on Illumina short reads; it might work on long/other reads but this remains to be tested and fastQC analysis might not be adequate and reported fail/pass status be misleading.
